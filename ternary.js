// Ternary means: composed of 3 parts

// Here is an example

var age = 13
age > 18 ? document.write("beer") : document.write("juice");

age<18? console.log("no drinky for u") : console.log("gud");


// Creates a new variable that compares the age variable.
// Ternary structure then sets two outcomes for senior variable.
// String can be written into document or console
var senior = age >= 65 ? "You're a senior" : "You're a junior"; document.write(senior);
